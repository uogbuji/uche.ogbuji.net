Olia, unu. That's Igbo for approximately "Hey, what's up, ya'll." My father tells me that it's the traditional, central Igbo informal greeting, and still the ones used by most of the older folks in our home town, Umunakanu. "Kedu" and its variants ("How are you") is probably the most common, modern Igbo greeting, and it originated from northern Igbo custom. "Ndewo", which matches up with English "Hello", is also common and more formal in central Igbo, and would often be used to greet one who has come to visit from afar, along with "i bia la" ("welcome" or more literally, "you've arrived") and in northern Igbo "nno" ("welcome").

I came from afar, from my home town of Umunakanu, my birthplace of Ikot Ene and my maternal hometown of Ikot Ana, all in verdant southeastern Nigera, to settle in Colorado, one of the most wonderful regions of the world. I'm a poet, and my debut collection, a chapbook called _["Ndewo, Colorado"](http://uche.ogbuji.net/ndewo/)_, published last year by [Aldrich Press](http://aldrichbookpublishing.blogspot.com/), just [won a Colorado Book Award](http://coloradohumanities.org/content/2014-colorado-book-awards). As you can gather from the last paragraph, its title means "Hello, Colorado". I've been a traveller my whole life, so greetings are important to me, and this new Weblog of mine is called "Olia".

I had a Weblog, [Copia](http://copia.ogbuji.net), during the golden age of Weblogs, shared with my brother, [Chimezie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chimezie). Its hybrid, self-maintained software became too much for us to deal with and we moved to Posterous, which eventually died. Copia is now hosted on Posthaven but I've grown disenchanted with the idea of entrusting a Weblog to a platform I don't control, and benefitting from the reëmergence of static Web tools, I use [Nikola](http://getnikola.com/) and Github publishing for Olia as well as my personal home page. Olia is just a collection of my own thoughts, and I'll no longer even be able to blame my brother for the more outré bits. I'll be talking technology (mostly Web technology), which is my livelihood, as well as poetry and literature, which are my passions, as well as football (soccer), language, maybe a bit of politics and the many other things that fascinate and occupy me.

I bia la. Nno. Welcome!
