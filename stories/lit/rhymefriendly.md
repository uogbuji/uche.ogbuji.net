.. slug: rhymefriendly
.. template: mavoapp.tmpl

I tend to prefer poems that rhyme. I think most do, but the contemporary culture of poetry seems to look at rhyme with distrust and sometimes outright contempt. I'm hoping to do my teensy bit to change that, starting with providing a resource for poets who work in rhyme looking to find publications friendly to their style of work.

I hope this is also useful for people who are interested in contemporary arts, and hoping to narrow down to journals in which they might find rhyming poetry. As such, I've included some journals which are rhyme-firendly, but not accepting unsolicited submissions at the moment.
